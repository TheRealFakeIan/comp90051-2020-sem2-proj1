## Who are my friends?
A machine learning model to predict fake connections in Twitter data.

### Requirements
- Environment for run a Jupyter Notebook. For example: [Jupyter Project](https://jupyter.org/install). A basic requirement for Jupyter Notebook is Python.   
- The data files utilized in this project should be in a folder named 'data' in the same directory that the file 'Neural Network for movie genre prediction.ipynb'.

### Compatibility
The libraries needed in this project are specified in the Jupyter Notebooks. The most general libraries utilized are:
- Python: 3.7.5
- Tensorflow: 2.0.0
- Keras: 2.2.4-tf

### Structure
- The complete version of this project is available [in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/alexantoniogonzalez2/comp90051-2020-sem2-proj1)
- 'data' folder: Contains the raw data available for this project. It is not added the file 'train.txt' which is available [in this Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/comp90051-2020-sem2-proj1/data)
- 'data_processing': Contains the main files to preprocess the raw data and generate files with a proper structure.
- 'data_generated': Contains the files generated in data preprocessing.
- 'data_models': Contains the dataset ready to be used by the machine learning models.
- 'predictions': Contains the prediction made by the different models.
- A research report is available [here](https://github.com/alexantoniogonzalez2/comp90051-2020-sem2-proj1).
